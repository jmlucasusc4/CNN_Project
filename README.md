# Convolutional Neural Network

In this project, I have created a Convolutional Neural Network using zipfile images of dogs and cats. 

# Neccesary Libraries have been imported

Including: (tensorflow and matplotlib)

# Test for GPU

# Preprocess the Test

Six convolutions were processed before being flattened followed by a print of the model summary.

# Training the Data

# Accuracy 

# Make a single prediction
